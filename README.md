# Calculator

Simple calculator app.

I've coded this without following a tutorial so it might not used the best approach when coding calculator. However I came up with every solution myself and only used stackoverflow and MDN if any problems arose.

Project is built using HTML, CSS and ES6 JS.

You can find the project here: https://skaic.netlify.app
